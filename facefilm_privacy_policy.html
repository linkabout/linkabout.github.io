3.2. Further Information on How We Process Face Data<br><br>

Allowing its Users to compare any face with the celebrities and find out which celebrity they look like, My Replica - Celebrity Like Me inevitably requires face data to make such comparisons. In order for this functionality to be possible, the app requires access to your device's camera and/or photos already stored in your device. This access can be toggled on or off at any time in your device's settings.<br><br>

In doing so, we use a third-party algorithm offered by Amazon Rekognition. The method detects the faces in the image provided by Users and extracts facial features into a feature vector. Later, extracted feature vectors are used to perform face match.<br><br>

The camera images and resulting data (feature vectors) are only used for the purposes of comparison. Once a session is complete we do not retain any of this facial data. Facial data is never stored to a disk. We do not perform facial recognition on your facial data.<br><br>

The app does not sync face data to a server or cloud. It is only transferred to and processed by Amazon Rekognition to obtain feature vectors from the face data provided and search celebrities collection for matching faces.<br><br>
